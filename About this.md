# Crop-Recommendation-System-using-machine-learning
Utilized supervised machine learning techniques to conduct a comparative analysis of diverse algorithms and determine the most accurate one for recommending suitable crops to farmers.

This project involves using of several software tools to develop a system for recommending crops using machine learning. The software components in this project use machine learning algorithms implemented in jupyter notebook to train and predict crops based on the collected data. Several regression models were evaluated. 
● A Decision tree model creates predictions by repeatedly segmenting data into subsets according to the values of the input attributes. The feature that causes the most decrease in variance is chosen for each split. The mean of the training examples in the leaf node that the tested example belongs to is used to determine the final prediction. 
● Extreme Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, is a well-liked and potent machine learning method that excels in a variety of tasks including classification and regression. To increase predicting accuracy, it combines the idea of gradient boost with further improvements. 
● k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) regression makes predictions based on the average value of the k closest training examples. The distance between examples is calculated using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance. 
● To provide more accurate predictions, the well-liked ensemble learning technique Random Forest combines the projections of several decision trees. 
● The Naive Bayes algorithm is a simple yet powerful probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It is particularly effective in intext classification and other domains with high-dimensional feature spaces. 
● Logistic Regression is a popular statistical model used for binary classification tasks. It models the relationship between a set of independent variables and a binary dependent variable, providing a probability-based approach to predict the likelihood of an instance belonging to a particular class. 
● ANNs are utilized in recommendation systems to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and historical data. 
● SVM stands for Support Vector Machine, which is a powerful supervised
12machine learning algorithm helpful for the couple classification and regressiontasks. SVMs are mainly effective in handling high-dimensional data . 
● The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that addresses the vanishing gradient problem and allows for the modeling of long-term dependencies in sequential
data. 
● The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) algorithm is an extension of the LSTM architecture that enhances its ability to capture both past and future information in sequential data. It was developed to address the limitations of traditional LSTMs, which only consider past context while processing sequences. 
● The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that addresses the vanishing gradient problem and facilitates the modeling of sequential data. 
● The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is a type of deep-learning model that is highly effective for processing and analyzing structured grid-like data, such as images, videos, and audio. 
This project includes concepts from the fields of machine learning.
