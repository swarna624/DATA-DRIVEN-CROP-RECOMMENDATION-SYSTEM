# üåæ Data-Driven Crop Recommendation System

A smart, ML-powered system that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on real-time agricultural data such as soil nutrients, weather conditions, and environmental parameters.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders by providing data-driven suggestions for crop selection. By using machine learning algorithms and historical data, the system predicts the best crop for given soil and climate conditions.

## üß† Key Features

- üîç Predicts optimal crops based on N, P, K values, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall
- üß™ Trained with real agricultural datasets
- üìä Easy-to-use interface for entering test parameters
- üåê Scalable architecture that can be deployed as a web or mobile app

## üìÇ Dataset

The system uses a dataset that includes:
- Soil nutrient levels: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
- Environmental factors: Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
- Soil pH level
- Target variable: Crop label
